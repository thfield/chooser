This is a page to help you choose things to buy from a store, or to see how many things you can buy for a certain amount of money.  It was inspired by an internet meme image showing you could buy a nexus 4, nexus 7 and a chromebook for the price of an iphone 5s.
I was in the process of teaching myself html/css/js and this seemed like a good project to cut my teeth on.
